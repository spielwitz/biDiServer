# Example Implementation 2

You can find another test implementation in package `jUnitTests.loadTest`. Run `LoadTest.java` as a jUnitTest. The load test creates a server with 10 users, and spawns 10 clients. Every client performs 10 random actions in parallel. The test takes about 5 seconds, of which 4 seconds are just wait statements.
